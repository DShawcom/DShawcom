            <h2>(Oct/Nov 2024) Designing and creating a monk costume for hallowe'en</h2>
            <p>After using my <a href="merlins-guide/merlinsguidemain.html">Elgomai Starbeam</a> costume as my hallowe'en costume last year, I cut my hair short and joked that I would grow my hair out until the <i>next</i> hallowe'en, at which point I would shave it all off and be a monk. <p> This, of course, meant that I had to actually do it. </p><p>Here's a video I made of the process, and of people's reaction to my shiny bald head.</p>

            <h2>(Oct/Nov 2024) Learning HTML and CSS to make this website</h2>
            <p>I've always thought it would be really cool to learn some web design. I'd never learned a "real" written programming language but I did quite a lot of Scratch when I was younger so I have a decent grasp of how to tell computers what I want them to do.</p>
            <p> Because there's a lot of back-and-forth traffic of files (video/audio mainly) a big deterrent from learning to code has always been how huge most of the coding applications are (typical installations of VS Code are a minimum of 20GB). But I finally found this really small code editor called PhoenixCode which is about half a gigabite. It's been fun to use. </p>
            <p>So I used some online tutorials and a lot of brute-forcing the correct syntax, and now I've finally got a website up and running! I'm really happy with how well this has turned out, and I'm lucky to have a unique enough name to have my own personal domain name for like 10CHF a year.</p>
